## Abstract

Disproportional incarceration of black and Hispanic men has been the subject of much critical commentary and empirical inquiry. Such disproportionality may be due to greater involvement of minority men in serious crime, to discretionary decisions by local justice officials, or to the differential impact of sentencing policies, such as mandatory minimums or sentencing guidelines, that differentially impact minority men. This study investigated the extent to which the disproportional punishment of black and Hispanic men, and local variation in such disproportionality, can be attributed to unexplained disparities in local sentencing decisions, as opposed to the extent to which such differences are mediated by sentencing policies, or case-processing and extralegal factors. We use 2005–2009 federal court and Pennsylvania state court data. Our findings suggest, particularly in Federal courts, that most disproportionality is determined by processes prior to sentencing, especially sentencing policies that differentially impact minority males.

“That is, perhaps sentencing policy structures, such as mandatory minimums or features of sentencing guidelines, encode racial, and ethnic disparity into sentencing by emphasizing punishment criteria that differentially impact blacks and Hispanics, especially males (Baumer, 2013; Engen, 2009; Frase, 2013; Ulmer, 2012).” (Ulmer et al., 2016, p. 643)“In particular, we address: (a) the extent to which disproportionate imprisonment of black and Hispanic men can be attributed to extralegal disparities in local sentencing stage decisions, and/or (b) the extent to which such differences are mediated by other factors, especially legally prescribed factors specified by sentencing structures such as guidelines or mandatory minimums.” (Ulmer et al., 2016, p. 644)“(1) sentencing data from US District Courts (from 2005 to 2009), and (2) sentencing data from Pennsylvania Courts of Common Pleas (from 2005–2009).” (Ulmer et al., 2016, p. 644)“To summarize, it may be that the majority of black and Hispanic male differentials in imprisonment and its length will be attributable to legally relevant, policy/guideline factors. Under this scenario, leftover locally based unwarranted disparity will be modest or insignificant once sentencing criteria prescribed by sentencing policy structures are accounted for. This would” (Ulmer et al., 2016, p. 647)“suggest that most racial/ethnic disproportionality is not due to local court sentencing-stage discretion, but rather is a by-product of the differential impact of sentencing policy. Alternately, there may be disparity at the sentencing stage affecting black and Hispanic males, and local variation therein, even after accounting for the influence of sentencing policy criteria. This would implicate the sentencing discretion of local courts in the production of racial/ ethnic disproportionality in imprisonment.” (Ulmer et al., 2016, p. 648)“The US Sentencing Guidelines are highly complex and detailed, and attempt to constrain judicial discretion to a much greater extent than state sentencing guidelines systems (Stith, 2008).” (Ulmer et al., 2016, p. 648)“Consistent with previous research, we exclude all immigration offenses because they are handled differently than other Federal crimes (see Ulmer, Light, & Kramer, 2011a). We include cases sentenced in 90 of the nation’s Federal districts (excluding the US Virgin Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Mariannas).” (Ulmer et al., 2016, p. 648)“We limited cases to the most serious offense per judicial proceeding and to non-DUI and non-traffic offenses.” (Ulmer et al., 2016, p. 648)“Our Federal analysis examines two dependent variables: (1) the likelihood of an imprisonment sentence, and (2) the length of imprisonment.” (Ulmer et al., 2016, p. 649)“Since the imprisonment length variable is positively skewed and regression diagnostics indicated problematic standard errors, we follow previous research and use the natural log.” (Ulmer et al., 2016, p. 649)“The Pennsylvania analysis examines two dependent variables: (1) multinomial logit models of incarceration and its type, and (2) sentence length.” (Ulmer et al., 2016, p. 649)“The incarceration type decision is modeled using the three categories of prison, jail, or non-incarceration.3 Non-incarceration serves as the reference category and includes probation, intermediate punishments, and restorative sanctions. The second dependent variable, sentence length is measured as the minimum length of incarceration associated with the most serious offense within a judicial proceeding. We use the natural logarithm of the incarceration sentence to adjust for the skewed and limited nature of the dependent variable.” (Ulmer et al., 2016, p. 649)“Our key variables are race-gender groupings with a focus on black males and Hispanic males. Race-gender groupings are measured with dummy variables: black (non-Hispanic) males, Hispanic (of any race) males, black (non-Hispanic) females, Hispanic females, white females, other race/ethnicity males, and other race/ethnicity females, with white non-Hispanic offenders serving as the reference category.” (Ulmer et al., 2016, p. 649)“The formula for converting b-coefficients of logged sentence length to % difference is ((Exp (b)) − 1) × 100 for positive coefficients and −1((1/Exp(b))−1) × 100 for negative coefficients (see Kurlychek & Johnson, 2004). The formula for negative coefficients is designed to remove the floor effects of odds ratios, since odds can never be less than zero (note: odds ratio = exp(b)). This yields, for example, the percent difference between whites and blacks in sentence length.” (Ulmer et al., 2016, p. 649)“Both our Federal and Pennsylvania analyses include legally relevant variables to assess the extent to which they mediate the effects of the race-gender groups.” (Ulmer et al., 2016, p. 650)“First, we control for the guideline recommended sentence. In both the Federal and Pennsylvania models, we include a measure of the presumptive sentence which is equal to the minimum months of incarceration recommended by the sentencing guidelines. The presumptive sentence takes into account the severity of the offense and criminal history.” (Ulmer et al., 2016, p. 650)(Ulmer et al., 2016, p. 650) Oh but we don't need to take the log of our explanatory variables. Their distribution doesn't matter.“Second, we include a dummy variable in both federal and state analyses indicating whether the offender was eligible for a mandatory minimum” (Ulmer et al., 2016, p. 650)“While criminal history is included in the presumptive sentence measure, we examine criminal history as a discretionarily considered but legally relevant variable in our Federal and Pennsylvania analyses” (Ulmer et al., 2016, p. 650)“We view offense type in a similar way—we examine the extent to which the Type A discretionary consideration of offense-type mediates race and ethnicity effects aside from the role of offense severity in the presumptive sentence.” (Ulmer et al., 2016, p. 650)“Both models add a predictor for whether the defendant received a departure (Federal: upward, downward, substantial assistance (5K1), or no departure-reference; Pennsylvania: upward, downward, no departure-reference) and mode of conviction (Federal: trial, guilty plea = reference; Pennsylvania: Trial, missing disposition, guilty pleas-reference). The Federal models further controlled for whether the case involved presentence detention, a variable which is highly correlated with pretrial detention/release in Federal court (Reitler, Sullivan, & Frank, 2013).” (Ulmer et al., 2016, p. 651)“Both analyses include other defendant characteristics. Age is included as a continuous variable in both the Pennsylvania and Federal analyses. The Federal models also include citizenship and education.” (Ulmer et al., 2016, p. 651)“HLM models are used as a fixed-effects approach to control out between-unit variation in sentencing as we systematically explore how legally relevant, case-processing, and other defendant status variables mediate the disproportional punishment of black and Hispanic males. Random effects for the black and Hispanic male variables are included to illustrate the between-court variation in these effects. We examine how between-court variation in the effects for these groups change as we account for legally relevant, case-processing, and other defendant characteristics.” (Ulmer et al., 2016, p. 651)“Our strategy is to start with fixed effects models of the federal imprisonment and prison term length decisions that include only the race/ethnicity and gender groupings. We progressively add the legally relevant, case-processing, and other defendant status variables. The models include random effects for the black and Hispanic male variables.” (Ulmer et al., 2016, p. 652)“Overall, the black male effect in Model 1 for the imprisonment decision is reduced by 78%, and the Hispanic male effect by 73%, in Model 8. For the prison length decision, the black male effect in Model 1 is reduced by 98%, and the Hispanic male length effect reduced by 94%. This strongly suggests that most of Federal imprisonment disproportionality is determined by processes prior to the sentencing decision, and for Hispanic defendants, US citizenship.” (Ulmer et al., 2016, p. 660)“The change from random effects in Models 1 to Model 8 illustrate the extent to which accounting for legally relevant, case-processing, and other defendant characteristics reduces the between-court variation in the black and Hispanic male effects. The results show that there is statistically and substantively significant variation overall between district courts in the punishment effects for black and Hispanic males, but this variation is substantially reduced by” (Ulmer et al., 2016, p. 660)“accounting for other factors. In terms of prison length, over 90% of the between district variation in prison lengths for black [((.03 − .01114)/.03) × 100 = 95% reduction] and Hispanic males [((.05 − .004)/.05) × 100 = 92% reduction] is explained by model 8.” (Ulmer et al., 2016, p. 663)“Our strategy is to start with fixed effects multinomial models of the incarceration-type decision and sentence-length decisions that include only the race/ ethnicity-gender groupings. The models include random effects for the black and Hispanic male variables. We progressively add the legally relevant, caseprocessing, and other defendant status variables.” (Ulmer et al., 2016, p. 663)“Overall, for prison vs. non-incarceration the black male effect in model 1 is reduced by 54% by model 7, while the Hispanic male effect is reduced by 26%. For jail (vs. non-incarceration) the black male effect in model 1 is reduced by 23% by Model 7 and the Hispanic male effect is reduced by 4%. For the sentence length decision, the black male effect in Model 1 is reduced by 93% by Model 7 and is no longer statistically significant, while the Hispanic male effect is reduced by 82%. As with the Federal analysis, much of the differences in sentencing between white males and both black and Hispanic males are explained by legally relevant guideline factors and mandatory minimums. For example, comparing Model 1 to Model 2 these legally prescribed factors mediate about 55% of the difference in imprisonment odds between black males and white males, and fully account for the sentence length differences between these groups.” (Ulmer et al., 2016, p. 671)“The random effects shown are from Models 1 and Models 7, and illustrate the between-county variation in the effects for black and Hispanic males. The change from random effects in Models 1 to Model 7 illustrate the extent to which accounting for legally relevant, case-processing, and other defendant characteristics reduces the between-county variation in the black and Hispanic male effects. The results show that there is significant variation overall between counties in the punishment effects for black and Hispanic males, and that controlling for case characteristics reduces between-county variation in the black and Hispanic male effects for some sentencing outcomes but not others. In terms of sentence length, about 90% of the between county variation in sentence lengths for both blacks [((.01 − .001)/.01) × 100 = 90% reduction] and Hispanic males [((.01 − .001)/.01) × 100 = 90% reduction] is explained by model 7.” (Ulmer et al., 2016, p. 671)“Finally, as a supplement to our analyses, we also looked at interactions between black male/Hispanic male status and presumptive sentence, mandatory minimums, and criminal history. Since these factors mediated substantial amounts of the disproportional punishment of black and Hispanic men, it raises the question of whether these factors also moderate the effects of policy structures and discretionary consideration of criminal history.” (Ulmer et al., 2016, p. 672)“These findings suggest that black male and Hispanic male status has less of an effect at higher criminal histories, similar to how Hispanic male status had less effect at higher presumptive sentences in the federal analysis. Recall that the criminal history effect in our models is a Type A discretionary one, beyond its effect through the guideline presumptive sentence.” (Ulmer et al., 2016, p. 673)
