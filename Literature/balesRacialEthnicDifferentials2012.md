## Abstract

Few criminological topics are as controversial as the relationships between race, ethnicity, crime, and criminal justice outcomes—especially incarceration. This paper assesses whether Blacks and Hispanics are disadvantaged at the sentencing phase of the justice system and whether the findings depend on the use of traditional regression-based methods to control for legally relevant variables vs. the use of precision matching methods, which attend to potential sample selection bias that occurs when there are not exact matches for those sentenced to incarceration and non-incarceration. Analysis of the population of Florida offenders from 1994 to 2006 using both methodologies indicates that Black offenders continue to be disproportionately incarcerated compared to White or Hispanic offenders, and that Hispanic offenders were slightly more likely than White offenders to be incarcerated.

> “Parceling of total arrest data by crime type shows that Whites comprised 67.6% of property crime arrests (and Blacks 29.8%), that Blacks comprised 38.9% of arrests for violent crimes (and Whites 58.7%)—— with Blacks comprising a higher percentage of arrests for murder (49.3 vs. 48.7%) and robbery (55.5 vs. 42.8%) compared to Whites (Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI], 2010, Table 43A).” (Bales and Piquero, 2012, p. 743)

There's significant evidence of overrepresentation of Black Americans in the arrests and crime statistics of (all?) types of crime according to FBI data. The sentences on "self-reporting" aren't clear to me. Does this mean the crimes are self-reported? Or is race self-reported?

> “Corrections data from 2009 reveals that the rate of Black prisoners under state or federal jurisdiction was 3,119 per 100,000, whereas for White prisoners it was 487 per 100,000, and for Hispanic prisoners it was 1,193 per 100,000.” (Bales and Piquero, 2012, p. 743)(Bales and Piquero, 2012, p. 743) 

There is also strong evidence of overrepresentation in incarceration rates. This seems to be more clear cut. Reported in per 100k instead of percentages as it was for arrests.

> “An important feature of our work is that we conduct separate analyses on the same data using traditional regression-based methods (which do not regularly deal with sample selection issues) and precision matching methods, which offer a potential remedy to sample selection bias that occurs when there are not exact matches for those sentenced to incarceration and non-incarceration.” (Bales and Piquero, 2012, p. 743)

Two methods for analysis: (logistic) regression and precision matching (what is precision matching?).

> “We focus on two specific strands of work: prison statistics and individual offender sentencing decisions.” (Bales and Piquero, 2012, p. 744)

> “Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) arrest statistics” (Bales and Piquero, 2012, p. 744)

What are UCR arrest statistics?

> “racial disproportionality in offending explained 80% of the racial disproportionality in prison populations.” (Bales and Piquero, 2012, p. 744)

So Blumstein is concluding that the disparity amount of arrests is only partly contributing to the disparity in prison populations.

> “Although they found that the observed racial disproportionality of prisons was primarily explained by arrest differentials (90%), there were important variations. In some states (New York and Kentucky), there was almost no discrimination as the percentage imprisonment disparity was fully explained (100%) by arrests, while in other states there were extreme differentials in arrests compared to imprisonment (Alabama 54%, Massachusetts 40%).” (Bales and Piquero, 2012, p. 745)

 For sentencing to be "just" I think we would be looking for the arrest disparity to explain 100% of the incarcerated disparity. "Just" here refers only to whether Black offenders are as likely to be imprisoned after arrest as non-Black offenders, ignoring the length of the sentence or whether the initial arrest is justified/racially motivated.It's unclear what exact methods the authors cited here used. "Disaggregated data" suggests that it was a logistic regression. A step ahead of Blumstein who seemingly took 43%/49% or some other simple approach.

> “Using data from the 1997 National Corrections Reporting Program, they found that the level of racial disproportionality in imprisonment decreased across all regions after considering race-specific arrests rates, but regional differences still emerged. These authors concluded that any remaining differences were a function of differential involvement in serious crimes across race, especially among Blacks in urban areas.” (Bales and Piquero, 2012, p. 745)

> “Harris, Steffensmeier, Ulmer, and Painter-Davis (2009) provided an important extension by using data on prison admissions and prison populations, including racially/ethnically disaggregated arrest and incarceration data from Pennsylvania for 2003-2007 that also included Hispanic offenders.” (Bales and Piquero, 2012, p. 745)

> “Third, among those offenses that evinced a within-race difference between arrest and incarceration representation, Hispanics experienced the greatest disadvantage.” (Bales and Piquero, 2012, p. 745)

> “A second strand of work has focused on individual offender sentencing outcomes with respect to either the in/out incarceration or the sentence-length decision.” (Bales and Piquero, 2012, p. 746)

> “Although race differences in the in/out decision are small, they are consistent and significant.” (Bales and Piquero, 2012, p. 746)

> “Steffensmeier, Ulmer, and Kramer (1998) examined the interaction of race, sex, and age in criminal sentencing” (Bales and Piquero, 2012, p. 746) 

Definitely sounds like they used logistic regression

> “This study further examines whether Blacks and Hispanics are disadvantaged at sentencing, but does so by considering the extent to which findings are contingent upon the traditional use of regression-based methods to control for legally relevant variables vs. the use of precision matching to derive equivalent race/ethnic groups.” (Bales and Piquero, 2012, p. 747)

> “We employ data from 1994 to 2006 for all felony defendants sentenced under the Florida sentencing guidelines and include a large set of variables, including those identified by Nagin, Cullen, and Jonson (2009) to be important predictors of the imprisonment decision (age, sex, current offense, and prior criminal history).” (Bales and Piquero, 2012, p. 748)

> “We examine: (1) if there are race/ethnic differences in the in/ out incarceration decision; (2) whether any observed disparity can be eliminated with controls for key variables; and (3) whether precision matching of cases by several key variables eliminates (or fails to eliminate) any observed disparities.” (Bales and Piquero, 2012, p. 748)

> “The guidelines data includes several important variables described below which are important when the goal is to identify and compare equivalent defendants, except for their race/ethnicity, who are sentenced to an incarceration/non-incarceration sanction.” (Bales and Piquero, 2012, p. 748)

So precision matching is used to identify defendants who have similar characteristics in every way except for race (or whatever thing we think is behind the disparity).

> “All offenders sentenced under the guidelines between 1994 and 2006 were identified. These data include: demographic information, the most serious offense at conviction, the current total offense(s) guidelines seriousness points, prior record seriousness scores, sentencing enhancement points, whether the guidelines recommended a prison sanction.” (Bales and Piquero, 2012, p. 748)

> “The records were matched to data contained in the FDOC’s Offender Based Information System (OBIS) to capture the number of prior felony convictions (total and for eight different crime types), prior prison commitments, and the number of prior community supervision violations.” (Bales and Piquero, 2012, p. 748) 

Matching is done on prior felony convictions (total and specific), prior incarceration, prior community supervision violations (parole?).

> “The outcome variable indicates whether defendants receive an incarceration sentence to prison or jail (=1) vs. a non-incarceration sanction in the form of some type of community supervision (=0).” (Bales and Piquero, 2012, p. 748)

> “Less than 1% of the cases (n=7,174) were excluded from the final file of 1,149,357 cases due to missing data. The following variables had missing data; age at sentencing (n=494), race (n=1,993), current offense (n=3), and sentence outcome (n=4,684).” (Bales and Piquero, 2012, p. 748) 

Here's our outline of the missing data.

> “Two variables of particular interest are race and ethnicity, which are measured using three dichotomous variables based on two variables, race and ethnicity” (Bales and Piquero, 2012, p. 751)

This is a terrible way to explain dummy variables. It is very difficult to parse out what is a really simple coding.

“An additional method of identifying Hispanic defendants involved comparing the surnames of offenders not designated as Hispanic from the guidelines or OBIS data with the US Census list of Hispanic surnames (Word & Perkins, 1996).” (Bales and Piquero, 2012, p. 751)

> “Several variables are included as controls to develop equivalent groups based on legally relevant factors used at sentencing. Age (in years) and sex were captured from the guidelines data.” (Bales and Piquero, 2012, p. 751) 

The control variables include: age, sex, current and prior offenses, sentencing guidelines suggested sentence, year of sentencing, judicial circuit

>“The most serious current offense at sentencing from the guidelines data is first measured through nine dummy variables for each type of crime: murder/manslaughter, sexual crimes, robbery, other violence, burglary, property, drugs, weapons, and other” (Bales and Piquero, 2012, p. 751)

> “An additional measure based on factors scored on the guidelines termed “special enhancements,” which include indicators such as victim injury, if the offender was on supervision at the time of their offense, etc.” (Bales and Piquero, 2012, p. 752)

> “To control for changes in sentencing laws over the 13-year period in which defendants were processed through the courts, we use 12 dummy variables for the year of sentencing. As, there are 20 judicial circuits in Florida responsible for processing and sentencing felony cases, we follow prior research (Britt, 2000; Johnson, 2006; Peterson & Hagan, 1984) and control for variation in judicial practices across jurisdictions by creating dummy variables for each circuit.” (Bales and Piquero, 2012, p. 752)

> “Two different analytic approaches are used to examine whether race and ethnicity have unique influences on sentencing decisions. First, the traditional regression-based method used prominently in the sentencing literature is used to predict the likelihood of an incarceration sentencing outcome. The second method used is precision matching, or what some refer to as “variable-by-variable” matching (Nagin et al., 2009, p. 145) or “precision control” matching (Seltiz, Jahoda, Deutsch, & Cook, 1959), and is conducted to derive equivalent groups, except for race and ethnicity.” (Bales and Piquero, 2012, p. 753)

> “As recently observed by Baumer (2010), this methodology has not been routinely applied in over several decades on racial/ethnic sentencing disparity research” (Bales and Piquero, 2012, p. 754) 

This method refers to exact matching

> “Second, some would argue that matching on more than a few factors can be problematic because relevant factors are typically interrelated and, therefore, one obtains diminishing returns as additional variables are included in the matching process” (Bales and Piquero, 2012, p. 754

> “It is important to note that precision matching and propensity score methods (PSM) are different ways of dealing with the selection bias issue. What precision matching offers is just that, precise matching on key variables. This may be especially relevant for variables such as race, sex, and especially age, which are related to offending, recidivism, and various criminal justice decisions (Nagin et al., 2009). Further, while precision matching and PSM are both designed to derive equivalent control and experimental groups to control for counterfactuals, they differ in the following respect. PSM seeks to derive equivalent control and experimental groups by matching cases based on their probability of being placed in the experimental group through the creation of propensity scores, derived typically from logistic regression models, based on the covariates available. Cases in the two groups are then matched based on these probabilities to derive presumably equivalent groups except for the treatment. The important feature of this approach is that cases are matched on the propensity score rather than explicitly on the covariates included in its estimation. This means that two matched individuals can have the same propensity score, but different values on the covariates that are indexed by it. In contrast, precision matching results in cases in the control and experimental groups that are exactly the same on all of the covariates included in the matching process.” (Bales and Piquero, 2012, p. 754)

This is the key explanation of matching. It's pretty straightforward but obviously requires a large data set.

> “to determine if the problem of sample selection bias using the former method is evident. Second, it may be more easily understandable that two groups, those incarcerated and those not incarcerated, were precisely matched on a host of characteristics known to influence sentencing decisions and were, therefore, identical except for their race and ethnicity.” (Bales and Piquero, 2012, p. 755) Can identify is sample selection bias is present and more easily understand the effect of race on sentencing.“to determine if the problem of sample selection bias using the former method is evident. Second, it may be more easily understandable that two groups, those incarcerated and those not incarcerated, were precisely matched on a host of characteristics known to influence sentencing decisions and were, therefore, identical except for their race and ethnicity.” (Bales and Piquero, 2012, p. 755)(Bales and Piquero, 2012, p. 755)

Can identify is sample selection bias is present and more easily understand the effect of race on sentencing.

> “Findings are presented for three questions: (1) Are there racial/ethnic differences in the decision whether to sentence defendants to incarceration or community supervision? (2) Does the inclusion of additional control variables to improve the equivalency in the two groups eliminate preliminary racial/ethnic effects (if they exist)? (3) Does the precision matching of cases through numerous legal variables known to impact sentencing outcomes alter the findings?” (Bales and Piquero, 2012, p. 756)
