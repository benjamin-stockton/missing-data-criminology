## Abstract

Current research on criminal case processing typically examines a single decision-making point, so drawing reliable conclusions about the impact that factors such as defendants’ race or ethnicity exert across successive stages of the justice system is difficult. Using data from the New York County District Attorney's Office that tracks 185,275 diverse criminal cases, this study assesses racial and ethnic disparity for multiple discretionary points of prosecution and sentencing. Findings from multivariate logistic regression analyses demonstrate that the effects of race and ethnicity vary by discretionary point and offense category. Black and Latino defendants were more likely than White defendants to be detained, to receive a custodial plea offer, and to be incarcerated—and they received especially punitive outcomes for person offenses—but were more likely to benefit from case dismissals. The findings for Asian defendants were less consistent but suggest they were the least likely to be detained, to receive custodial offers, and to be incarcerated. These findings are discussed in the context of contemporary theoretical perspectives on racial bias and cumulative disadvantage in the justice system.

“Investigating racial inequity across successive stages of the justice system is important for several reasons. To the extent that racial minorities are treated more punitively, cumulative disadvantages may emerge that are substantial and that go undetected in singlestage studies (Spohn, 2009)” (Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 515)“Survey research has demonstrated that minority respondents report lower levels of trust and confidence in the justice system; they also are more likely to believe that the system is racially biased (Hagan and Albonetti, 1982; Hagan, Shedd, and Payne, 2005). Perceived injustice is important because it fuels racial differences in assessments of the legitimacy of the criminal justice system, which can contribute to a variety of negative life outcomes, such as increased crime rates, worsening race relations, and ongoing social inequalities in other life domains (LaFree, 1998; Tyler, 2007).” (Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 515)“Data on arrests and prison statistics demonstrate consistent disproportionality in racial contact with the system.” (Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 515)“To understand better the locus and magnitude of racial differences in punishment, it is useful to conceptualize the punishment process as a dynamic set of interrelated decisionmaking points (Baumer, 2013; Blumstein et al., 1983; Ulmer, 2012).” (Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 515)“Collectively, this work has suggested that although legally relevant factors exert the strongest influence on punishment, significant disadvantages remain for Black and Latino defendants net of legal considerations (Mitchell, 2005; Spohn, 2000; Zatz, 2000). In addition, evidence suggests that the degree of racial disparity in sentencing is conditioned by other factors, such as the age, gender, and employment status of the defendant (Spohn, 2000; Spohn and Holleran, 2000; Steffensmeier, Ulmer, and Kramer, 1998),” (Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 516)“Comparatively little research has focused on racial disparity in prosecution, even though prosecutors have broad and largely unregulated case-processing authority (Forst, 2002), and few studies have examined the cumulative effects of race across multiple discretionary points (Albonetti, 1987; Baumer, 2013).” (Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 516)“It seems likely that the inconsistency in prior findings reflects in part the fact that researchers examined different decision-making points in different jurisdictions and often focused on specific crime types” (Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 517)“Many scholars have argued that a key limitation of extant sentencing research is its failure to consider the conditioning effects of the many consequential case-processing decisions that precede the final punishment decision (Baumer, 2013; Piehl and Bushway, 2007; Ulmer, 2012). These scholars have pointed out that focusing on a single decision-making stage (i.e., sentencing) may mask disparities originating at other discretionary points in the system.” (Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 517)“This study responds to Sutton’s call for additional research designed to identify cumulative disadvantage in the prosecution and sentencing of criminal defendants. We build on his work by using similar analytical procedures to estimate cumulative disadvantage using a large sample of defendants charged with misdemeanors and felonies in New York City.” (Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 518)“According to the focal concerns perspective, decision makers attempt to tailor outcomes to fit the facts and circumstances of each case, but in practice, they often have incomplete information about important details of the crime and the defendant.” (Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 519)“Collectively, these theoretical arguments imply a consistent pattern of disadvantage for minority defendants across successive stages of criminal case processing.” (Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 520)“We examine both possibilities. Hypothesis 1: Black and Latino defendants will be more likely than similarly situated White defendants to experience outcome-specific disadvantages at individual stages of criminal case processing. Hypothesis 2: Black and Latino defendants will be more likely than similarly situated White defendants to experience cumulative disadvantages across combinations of more punitive criminal case-processing outcomes” (Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 520)“Finally, one common criticism of research on racial disparity in punishment is that socioeconomic factors are seldom examined (Zatz, 2000). Although scholars continue to debate the relative importance of race and class, most acknowledge their long-standing association and the importance of attempting to disentangle their effects (Feagin, 1991; Hughes and Thomas, 1998; Wilson, 1978).” (Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 521)“We test these hypotheses using unique data on criminal case processing in the New York County District Attorney’s office (DANY).” (Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 521)(Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 522) Some level of convenience "sampling" by getting DANY data since they are "unusual[ly] willing to cooperate with researchers on examining racial issues."“In New York County, after defendants are arrested, police bring cases to DANY’s Early Case Assessment Bureau (ECAB), where assistant district attorneys (ADAs) decide whether to accept or decline cases for prosecution. ADAs also decide what charges to bring against a defendant.” (Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 522)“Data for this study were collected over a 20-month period, during which researchers worked closely with DANY to identify, collect, and analyze a wide range of data.3” (Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 522)“The data consist of 159,206 misdemeanors and 26,069 felonies accepted for prosecution by DANY and disposed of in 2010–2011. Whereas the misdemeanor cases include all misdemeanors, felony cases include five commonly occurring offense types: drug offenses, robberies, weapons offenses, burglaries, and cases flagged as domestic violence.” (Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 522)“also, a “plea” or “conviction” charge was not used because many cases do not make it to these later stages. Our data, however, included arrest charge information as well, which we used when examining the initial case screening decision for all cases whether accepted for prosecution or not.” (Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 523)“This study examines the treatment of racial and ethnic groups across five dependent variables, beginning with the decision to file charges and ending with the decision regarding the type of sentence that is imposed. The first dependent variable is Case Acceptance, which captures the ADA’s initial screening decision; i” (Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 523)“The second dependent variable is Pretrial Detention, which is coded 0 for defendants who are released (on bail or on their own recognizance) and 1 for those who are detained.4” (Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 523)“The third dependent variable is Case Dismissal, which measures whether the case is dismissed by the prosecutor or judge at any subsequent stage of criminal case processing” (Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 523)“The fourth dependent variable is Custodial Plea Offer, which measures whether defendants receive custodial sentence offers (i.e., an offer for a sentence to jail or prison [coded 1]) or noncustodial sentence offers (i.e., an offer that involves community service, fine, time served, or conditional discharge [coded 0]).” (Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 523)“Finally, the last dependent variable is Incarceration Sentence, which captures whether a judge imposes a custodial (coded 1) or noncustodial (coded 0) sentence.” (Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 524)“The primary independent variable of interest is the race or ethnicity of the defendant, which is measured using dummy variables for White, Black, Latino, Asian, and “other” defendants, with Whites the omitted reference category.5” (Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 524)“We also control for defendant’s age and sex. A” (Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 524)“Several additional variables are included to control for the legal characteristics of the offense.” (Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 524)“Finally, although no direct measures of social class are available in the data, two proxy variables are included that at least partially capture the socioeconomic background of defendants. The first is the type of defense counsel, which includes separate categories for private attorney (the reference group), court-appointed attorney (commonly referred to as an 18(b) attorney), and three public defender groups unique to New York City:” (Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 524)“The second socioeconomic proxy is the neighborhood where the arrest occurred,” (Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 525)“To investigate racial and ethnic differences in outcome-specific and cumulative disadvantage, we estimate a series of multivariate logistic regression models.” (Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 526)“The first model includes only the racial and ethnic background of the defendant, which provides insight into baseline differences in case processing across racial and ethnic groups. The second model introduces legal control variables, which addresses concerns that racial differences may reflect differences in legal case characteristics. Finally, the third and full model incorporates all variables, including the proxies for socioeconomic characteristics—the arrest neighborhood and type of defense counsel.” (Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 526)(Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 526) Again we're analyzing nested models instead of just the final model.“When examining multiple discretion points, it is important to consider the possibility of selection bias caused by previous decision points.” (Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 526)“we include pretrial detention as a control in subsequent analyses of case dismissals, custodial plea offers, and incarceration sentences. The same cannot be done for other intermediate decisions, however, because their temporal ordering is not always clear:” (Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 526)“Second, although case dismissal decisions clearly precede incarceration decisions, they cannot be included as a control in that model because all case dismissals necessarily result in no incarceration. However, we address this issue by using Heckman’s correction for selection bias” (Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 526)“we ran separate models for person, property, and drug offenses,” (Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 527)“we calculate predicted probabilities, separately for felonies and misdemeanors, from multivariate regression models predicting membership in different combinations of outcomes (e.g., being detained, not dismissed, and incarcerated for felony offenses)” (Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 527)“the first dependent variable, Case Acceptance, lacked sufficient variation—most cases were initially accepted for prosecution—so separate regression analyses are not reported for that outcome.” (Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 527)“As noted, the analyses of Plea Offers were necessarily limited to misdemeanor cases because plea bargains for felony cases were seldom made at arraignment and were therefore not reliably recorded in the data. Final sentencing outcomes in felony cases may therefore reflect important elements of prosecutorial plea bargaining discretion as well as judicial sentencing discretion. All other analyses report the full results for all cases for each outcome of interest.” (Kuta℡adze et al., 2014, p. 527)
